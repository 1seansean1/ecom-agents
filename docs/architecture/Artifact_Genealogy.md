# Holly Grace → Artifact Genealogy & Derivation Graph

**Generated:** 17 February 2026
**Purpose:** Complete lineage of every artifact in the Holly Grace codebase. This document traces how the project was actually built — from first literature review through to the execution loop that produces code. Nothing in the repo exists without a derivation chain back to a source.

## 1  The Mega Graph

Every node is an artifact that exists (or existed as a research phase). Every edge is a derivation relationship: the target was produced *from* the source. Color coding: red = external research, blue = theory/monograph, green = architecture, orange = specifications, purple = process/governance, gray = execution outputs.
