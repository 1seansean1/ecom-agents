## From Informational Monism to Autonomous Operations

The framework begins from a single ontological commitment: every system — computational, biological, organizational — is a network of information !channels, and the dynamics that matter are the dynamics of those channels. Channel theory supplies the microdynamics: tokens flow through typed conduits whose capacity, noise, and coupling are measurable quantities. When channels compose, they induce macro-channels with emergent bandwidth and loss characteristics that are not simple sums of their parts. Admissibility conditions distinguish passive transport — information flowing through a structure — from active regeneration, where a subsystem reconstructs and redirects"
